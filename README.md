## ･ﾟ･✧ ♡ Compatibility Calculator ♡ ✧･ﾟ･
Calculates the compatibility % between two individuals based on a combination of attributes such as 
* initials
* star signs
* blood types
* mbti
* chinese zodiac animal

The final percentage is a weighted average of the compatibility of each individual attribute. 

NOTE: the results are in _**NO way**_ an accurate indication of your compatibility or how well you get along with another individual. 

Like all other compatibility calculators on the internet, this is intended for _**fun**_ only ♡

The compatibility of each individual attribute is calculated similarly to existing popular sites using currently more widely accepted beliefs.
